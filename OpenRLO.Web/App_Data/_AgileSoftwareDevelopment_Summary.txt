Agile Software Development is an adaptive, incremental approach to creating software, with a focus on team communication and close business collaboration. There are a number of popular well known development methodologies associated with Agile, including *Scrum* and *Extreme Programming*. Agile places a strong emphasis on 4 core values:

* Individuals and interactions valued over processes and tools
* Working software valued over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration valued over contract negotiation
* Responding to change valued over following a plan

These 4 core values lead into a set of 12 principles, which have several common themes running through them:

* The customer, business team, and users come first.
* Expect and embrace change.
* Iterate and continuously deliver.
* Continuously improve through reflection, inspection, and adaptation.
