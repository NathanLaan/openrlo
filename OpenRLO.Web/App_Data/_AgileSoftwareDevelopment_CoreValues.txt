There are four core values that constitute the real heart of what Agile Software Development stands for ([Newkirk, 2002][1]).

1. Individuals and interactions valued over processes and tools
2. Working software valued over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration valued over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change valued over following a plan
