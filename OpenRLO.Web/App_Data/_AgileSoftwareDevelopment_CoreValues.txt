There are four core values that form the foundation of Agile Software Development ([Beck et al., 2001][1]; [Newkirk, 2002][2]).

1. Individuals and interactions valued over processes and tools
2. Working software valued over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration valued over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change valued over following a plan
