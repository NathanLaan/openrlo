> *"Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."*

It is important to gather the right team with the right skills ([Augustine, 2004][1], [Larman, 2004][1]). It is also important to produce good code with a good design ([Lindstrom, & Jeffries, 2004][2]). Making sure you have a good team will pay off in the long run, and enable your team to be more agile ([Lindstrom, & Jeffries, 2004][2], [Newkirk, 2002][3]).
