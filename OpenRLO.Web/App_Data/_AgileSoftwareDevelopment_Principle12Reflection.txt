> *"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly"*

* Reflect
* Inspect
* Adapt

The agile process calls for teams to be introspective. Teams that are able to reflect on their triumphs, successes, failures, and mistakes will be better able to adapt and improve over time ([Augustine, 2005][1]; [Larman, 2004][2]; [Newkirk, 2002][3]).
