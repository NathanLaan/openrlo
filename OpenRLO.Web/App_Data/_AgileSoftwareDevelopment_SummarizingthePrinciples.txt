The 12 principles of agile software development have four common themes running through them ([Lindstrom, & Jeffries][2004][1]).

* The customer, business team, and users come first.
* Expect and embrace change.
* Iterate and continuously deliver.
* Continuously improve through reflection, inspection, and adaptation.

These themes are, in many ways, philophical or ideological in nature. They form a strong foundation for all 12 of the principles of agile software development.
