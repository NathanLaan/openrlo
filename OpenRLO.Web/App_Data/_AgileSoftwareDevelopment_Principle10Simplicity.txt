> *"Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential."*

Minimize the amount of work required. Simplicity is not easy, but it leads to *conceptual integrity* which pays off in the long run ([Ambler, 2002][1]; [Eckstein, 2009][2]). Having good leadership, and moving towards a common goal can help achieve simplicity ([Eckstein, 2009][2]).
