  <h2>ABOUT</h2>
  <p>This site is powered by <a href="http://anetro.com">Anetro</a>, a web publishing system designed for simplicity and clarity. The features and functionality of the site have been purposefully kept to the bare minimum. On the back-end, the site does not use a database, or have any external software dependencies. It is entirely self-contained. On the front-end, the site aims to provide simple, clean URLs for all content, while avoiding the issues caused by <a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/javascript/BreakingTheWebWithHashBangs">hash-bang URLs</a>.</p>
  <p>The design and layout of the site is based on the <a href="http://960.gs">960 Grid System</a>. It's a relatively old system and it's not the latest or greatest, but it works, it's well tested and, best of all, it's simple.</p>
